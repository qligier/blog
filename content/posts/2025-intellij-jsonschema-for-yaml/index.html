<p>
    This is another article about plugin development for IntelliJ-based IDEs.
    In this article, I am describing how to implement some support for YAML files using a JSON Schema, which is a nifty
    feature of JetBrains IDEs.
    It is possible because JSON and YAML are very similar formats, and the JSON Schema standard can be applied to YAML
    files as well, without many issues.
</p>

<p>
    I recently implemented that trick in my plugin
    <a href="https://github.com/qligier/jetbrains-plugin-fss" title="qligier/jetbrains-plugin-fss: FHIR® and SUSHI Support plugin for JetBrains IDEs">FHIR® and SUSHI Support</a>
</p>

{{< h2 "Supported features" >}}

<p>
    The features automatically provided by JetBrains IDEs (at the time of writing) when a JSON Schema is associated with a
YAML file are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Autocompletion suggestions based on the schema</li>
    <li>Validation of values based on the defined type and constraints</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Notably, the following features are NOT supported:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Despite setting <code>"additionalProperties": false</code> on an object, extra properties are not marked as errors.</li>
    <li>Others?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    First, we need a JSON Schema to work with.
